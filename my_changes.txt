ome_firmware_baseline_compliance_info.py:
- Updated the module to remove the requirement for mutual exclusivity other than between baseline name and devices
- Fixed a bug where groups with more than a page size worth of devices was not handled correctly
- Addressed #171
- Added the ability to use idrac IPs to identify a device
- Added the ability to use a device name to identify a device
- Updated module documentation to reflect changes
- Added reST docstring comments for all functions in ome_firmware_baseline_compliance_info.py
- Removed the functions _get_device_id_from_service_tags, get_device_ids_from_group_ids, get_device_ids_from_group_names, get_identifiers because the functionality is now all centralized in the ome module.
- Removed the function get_baselines_report_by_device_ids because it was simplified to only two lines and is not reusable in other code
- Removed the function get_baseline_compliance_reports because it could be simplified to 5 lines and is not reusable in other code
- Removed exception handling from get_baseline_id_from_name because it did not add any handling unique to the function - it only raised the error and then passed it to another, identical, exception handler

ome.py:
- Added a get_targets function to ome.py which creates an array of all target ids (from service tags, device names, idrac ips, and groups)
- Added a get_device_id function that accepts a service tag, idrac ip, or device name and resolves it to a device ID using odata filters instead of an exhaustive list search
- Added an InputError exception class which can pass data regarding failures in user input
- Updated the documentation for some functions which did not correctly adhere to reST
